1.) traing with all data (now only trained with data_batch_1)
2.) last part of question 1, understanding what is the meaning of "Plot the error resulting from representing the images of each category "
3.) need to check with others to see if this is how other ppl calculate distances between mean image in question 2
4.) question 3
